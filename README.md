## Introduction
Following up with the [previous repository](https://github.com/YimingZ13/Student_Engagement_Analysis_SQL_Tableau/tree/main), the 365 platform is now asking us to analyze whether the new additions to the platform (new courses, exams, and career tracks) have increased student engagement, comparing the second quarter of 2021 to that of 2022. This project aims to analyze and track student engagement on an online learning platform by leveraging SQL for data extraction, Excel for hypothesis and probability testing, and Python for data preprocessing and modeling. The insights derived from this project will help improve the learning experience and enhance student outcomes. 

The following is the hypothesis we are going to test:

- **Hypothesis**: The first half of 2022 was anticipated to be a profitable period for the company, driven by a hypothesized boost in student engagement following the release of several new features on the platform at the end of 2021. These features included the ability to enroll in career tracks and assess knowledge through practice exams, course exams, and career track exams. Additionally, the expansion of the course library aimed to attract a broader audience by covering more topics, thereby increasing user engagement. By analyzing various metrics, we can evaluate the impact of these new features and assess the overall engagement levels of our users.

This project involves the following key components:

- **Data Extraction with SQL**: Use SQL queries to extract relevant data from the platform's database, including user activity logs, course completion records, and assessment results.
- **Hypothesis and Probability Testing with Excel**: Conduct statistical analysis and hypothesis testing using Excel to uncover trends and validate assumptions about student behavior and engagement.
- **Data Preprocessing and Modeling with Python**: Utilize Python for cleaning, transforming, and modeling the data. Machine learning models will be developed to predict engagement outcomes and identify key factors influencing student success.
